# qmk folder contents
* `justfile` a justfile sample I use to automatizate my tests, download the config from config.qmk.fm, compile with my ferris board, and flash it all at once
* `ferris_sweep_new-dracks...uf2` the firmware compile for my keyboard
* `new-dracks.json` the configuration of qmk for my keyboard, keep in mind that is designed to be use with querty-es, any other qwerty layouts can be fully broken.
