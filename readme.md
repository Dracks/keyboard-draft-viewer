# keyboard draft viewer
This project is a quick and dirty code, done with cloude, to make easy to visualize a new layout for my new ferris sweep.

## why?
The main reason is, that as spanish, I use qwerty es, and qmk online config doesn't show the es simbols/keys. 

## how it works
* use pnpm or any other packages to install the dependencies.
* run it with `pnpm dev` or similar
* modify the main.ts file (maybe in a future I will create some better file format) as your liking
* then you can visualize with hotreload in your browser

you only need to provide the strings.

## example
you can find inside the folder qmk the json config and compiled firmware for qmk ferris keyboard
